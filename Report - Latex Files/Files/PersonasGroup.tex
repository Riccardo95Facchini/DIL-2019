The main purpose of the application is to bring closer people living in the area, mainly those that are fishing pros and people who come to the area because of fishing and other similar activities in the nature, everything to the economic benefit of locals without damaging the already fragile environment. It is expected that it could also attract new people unaware of the region to visit the area. 
Since we decided to focus on fishing aspect, our target group are \textbf{fishing enthusiasts}, which can actually be divided into two different groups:
\begin{itemize}
\item Locals.
\item Tourists.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Their needs}
\paragraph*{Locals} need a new income system, something new that could bring jobs and opportunities in the area using
the natural environment of the zone such as the river and the woods that follow the Elk River.
\paragraph*{Tourists} coming from other counties want instead a different experience, somewhere new where
they can fish different species and enjoy a new area different from the ones they usually go to.
\subsubsection{What are we offering them?}
A service that will facilitate the organization and the building of an infrastructure for fishing enthusiasts using
modern technologies, this would create new job opportunities (such as local guides, fishing instructors,
boat rentals, ecc...) for the locals and allow tourists to easily come to the Elk River and enjoy
a weekend without the stress of organizing everything by themselves.
\subsubsection{Other information}
\paragraph*{How many are there?} About 1.5Million.
\paragraph*{How many will we reach?} Around 50.000 people.
\paragraph*{How frequently will we interact with them?} Weekly.
\paragraph*{What do we get in return?} Economic growth.
\paragraph*{How can our relationship grow?} With people talking about the service.
