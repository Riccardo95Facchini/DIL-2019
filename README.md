<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Elk River is an area that in recent years experienced a decline in population and turism, mainly due to the chemical spills that impacted the area.<br/>
Our job was to find an innovative solution to the problems of the area and to do so we did a data analysis study and developed an [Android application](https://github.com/Riccardo95Facchini/Elk_River_DIL_2019) that would allow locals and tourists in the fishing community to get in touch for lessons, renting equipment or discovering the perfect fishing spot.<br/>
Specific informations about all the projects aspects are available in detail in the [Report.pdf](https://github.com/Riccardo95Facchini/DIL-2019/blob/master/Report.pdf) or in a summary format in the [Presentation.pptx](https://github.com/Riccardo95Facchini/DIL-2019/blob/master/Presentation.pptx)
