\subsection{Target Group - Fishing Enthusiasts}
The main purpose of the application is to bring closer people living in the area, mainly those that are fishing pros, and people who come to the area because of fishing and other similar activities in the nature, everything to the economic benefit of locals without damaging the already fragile environment. It is expected that it could also attract new people unaware of the region to visit the area. Therefore, the two groups in the focus are:  
\newline
\textbf{Locals:} they need a new income system, possibly based on a clean use of the natural resources and environment 
\newline
\textbf{Others:} they want a new and different place where to practice their passion and try different fishing techniques 
\newline 
\newline
Two personas representing each of the groups are given in the following section.
